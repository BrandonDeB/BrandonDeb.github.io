Hi, I’m Brandon—a computer science student at LSU, set to graduate in May 2025. I’m passionate about combining creativity with technical precision, whether I’m developing AI solutions or crafting intuitive front-end designs. I also have a keen interest in exploring emerging technologies like low-level programming and blockchain, always eager to expand my skill set.

My approach to coding is rooted in writing clean, efficient, and purposeful code. I love the problem-solving process and the opportunity to create something impactful.

Outside of programming, you’ll often find me on the court playing basketball or volleyball, traveling to new places, or diving into a good book.

Thanks for stopping by my portfolio—I’m excited to connect and explore how we can build something great together!
