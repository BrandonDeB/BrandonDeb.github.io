# What is Toga?
Toga is a clothing exchange app directed towards Greek life students in college. Unlike typical clothing exchanges, Toga focuses on providing clothes specifically themed for events occuring on campus. Our team's hope is by creating a safe and useful platform, students can save money on clothes and also clean out their own closets.
# The Process
## The Idea
The major component of CSC 4330 Software Systems Development is the five person group project spanning the whole semester. While I knew Landon before the project, the rest of my group found each other through the course GroupMe channel. The original idea for Toga stemmed from Landon wanting to create a digital wardrobe. Professor input moved it more in the direction of a clothing exchange directed towards college students.

We continued brainstorming, creating a project proposal filled with user stories, a concept logo, and requirements. The full document may be found here ![[Milestone 1 - Product Strategy Document.pdf]]
## The design process
With a general idea for the app created, the focus became designing the UI/UX. Our group met and drew note cards for our low fidelity prototype. ![Our Low-Fidelity Prototype](/assets/img/Toga/lo-fi.jpg)

Landon and I then turned this initial vision into a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/oYVPLUYH6nGExbHR8Suogx/Toga?node-id=307-555&t=rPRKA1CPaE9aQOzw-1) project. This design process took over a month of dedicated effort. Our professor was even nice enough to have IBM interface engineers look over our work to help fix it. The final product was far nicer than what we had initially and I learned a lot from it.
## Coding
Now came the coding. To keep this brief the project was built on a React Native front end, a Node.JS back end, and it utilized numerous resources such as Firebase for image storage and Render for a PostgreSQL database and hosting.
### What I contributed
- Skeleton for most of the front end (my designs were not beautiful so some of our other group members made it prettier)
- Front end support for login authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- Front end and back end implementation of user groups, bookmarking clothing, posting clothes, removing backgrounds from images, and adding clothes to events
### What I learned
- Improved my React skills
- Learned image storage through Firebase
- Better my understanding of web sessions
- Improved styling and design
- NodeJS

## The Presentation
Here are the presentation slides I built. Our presentation got a 9/10 and I went over our demo. [Canva View Link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGXr9CIvM4/iqR5JQsqppUTZZtTu53aqg/view?utm_content=DAGXr9CIvM4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h63befa60e5)
